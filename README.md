# OnlyINS: Standalone Inertial Navigation System

A standalone Inertial Navigation System (INS) for applications requiring autonomous navigation without reliance on external signals.

## Overview

OnlyINS is a software package that provides a solution for navigating solely based on Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. It is designed for scenarios where GNSS signals are not available or unreliable, ensuring continuous operation.

## Key Features

- **Standalone Operation**: Functions independently without the need for GNSS or other external aids.
- **Dead Reckoning**: Utilizes IMU data to estimate the change in position over time.
- **High Reliability**: Engineered to maintain performance in challenging environments.
- **Open Source**: Benefits from community contributions and peer review.
